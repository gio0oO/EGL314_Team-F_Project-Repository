## Spotlight Light Show
The purpose of creating this file is to show the player where the targets are since they would be playing in the dark classroom.<br>
<img src="Captures/SpotlightWindow.png" alt="Spotlight Window" width="500" height="300"/><br>
The Mistrals are panned and tilted towards the different spots where the targets will be placed.<br>
Not only will it visually aid the players in game, but it also acts as markers for us to place the targets when we set up the station.
