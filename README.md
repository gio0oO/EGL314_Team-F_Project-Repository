# TeamF_EGL314

We are Team F of the MTS 2024 Batch and in this repository, it features documentation of our project S.O.N.I.C Game Station 1. It includes all the installations made, raspi codes and operation procedures. 

Our game station is a stealth walking station that requires players to pass through a obstacle filled path using <b>Piezo Disk</b> and <b>Ultrasonic sensors</b> as fast as possible without detetcting them, testing the player's agility and abilty to be stealthy. 
We have designed a poster to explain the rules and will be uploaded below.
