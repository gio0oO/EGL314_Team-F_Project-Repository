# TeamF_EGL314

We are Team F of the MTS 2024 Batch and in this repository, it features documentation of our project S.O.N.I.C Game Station 1. It includes all the installations made, raspi codes and operation procedures. 

Our game station is a Target Practice station that requires players to shoot at targets with shurikens. Their aim is to hit at the correct targets indictated by directional audio cues, meaning if a sound comes from that target, that is the target to aim for. T
We have designed an A4 poster to explain the rules and will be uploaded below.
