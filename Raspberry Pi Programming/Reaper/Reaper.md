# Reaper Raspberry Pi Programming

Welcome to the Reaper portion of the Raspberry Pi Programming. Below, you'll find the codes utilized and their functionalities:

## Main Control

- **Main_Gui.py**: This main file orchestrates the entire game. Here, you have control over the Reaper, GrandMA3, and the ability to start the game. Additionally, you can observe when the board has been hit by the player through the flashing red box.

## Markers

- **marker_1.py** to **marker_10.py**: These files allow you to skip to the set marker within the Reaper file. You can create more or less of these files depending on the number of markers you have.

## Playback Control

- **play_stop.py**: This script handles the playback and stopping of the Reaper file.
