# Sensor Detection with Piezzo Sensors

This section focuses on the detection of the board being hit through Piezzo sensors. The following files are used for this purpose:

## Main Scripts

- **Main1.py** and **Main2.py**: These scripts handle the detection of the board being hit through the Piezzo sensors. Additionally, they execute two files: **marker_1.py** and **play_stop.py**, which play a reaper marker.

These scripts are pivotal in monitoring and responding to interactions with the board through Piezzo sensors.
