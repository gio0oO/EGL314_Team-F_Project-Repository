# GrandMA3 Raspberry Pi Programming

Welcome to the GrandMA3 portion of the Raspberry Pi Programming. Below, you'll find the codes utilized and their functionalities:

## Sequences

- **Sequence1.py** to **Sequence8.py**: These files are responsible for initiating the sequences configured on our GrandMA3. We've utilized 8 sequences in this setup, but you can adjust the number according to your game's requirements.

## Control

- **OffSequence.py**: This script serves to deactivate all sequences. It ensures smooth transitions and prevents any conflicting lighting fixtures from being activated. Additionally, it offers a simple way to turn off all sequences when needed.
