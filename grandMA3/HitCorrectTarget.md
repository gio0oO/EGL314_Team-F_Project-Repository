## Hit Correct Target Lightshow 
This Light show is fairly simple as the audio cue that accompanies it is short. This show only requires the Mistrals and Mini Panel to strobe red beams of light to the floor.Using the Phaser tool, ensure that step 1 has all the Mini Panels at 100 percent for Dimmer Levels, with the Color Green and then at 0 percent on step 2. After setting the Phaser, I stored the cue into Sequence Group 3 and renamed it "Hit Correct Target."
